# Prework

This is a list of the current prework.

These add up to a total of at most 70 hours of work.  There will be a coding challenge the week/weekend before class starts.

If you finish this list, donâ€™t stop, keep going.  The more you learn before class the better off you will be.  Free Code Camp has many many more paths to explore.  Each branch of their curriculum ends with sets of projects and you can get a certificate if you like that kind of thing.
